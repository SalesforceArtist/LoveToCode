To run the code examples found in this directory, you'll
need NodeJS installed (version 4.0 or later). With Node 
installed, we need to install the npm package dependencies. 
Simply run the following from the command line (make sure 
you're in this directory):

  npm install

This will install the listed dependencies in package.json.
Next, well need to install a couple global packages, because
they're used on the command line. Here's how you do that:

  npm install -g grunt-cli http-server

Now we can build the examples. Simply run grunt from the
command line, within this directory:

  grunt

This will build all the ES5 code that works in any browser. The
ES6 source the examples are written in work in some browsers,
but not others. Now you can start the web server, and visit
http://localhost:8080 (the port is a configurable http-server
option):

  http-server

All the examples, organized by chapter (2-7), are linked to from 
the index page. There's no code examples for chapter 1. Chapters
8 and 9 have NodeJS code examples, and so it's navigate into the
chapter directory from the command line and invoke node directly.
Here's an example:

  cd chapter8/writing-to-files
  node main.js

The final chapter, 10, is a full-fledged node application. So it
has front-end and Node components. To start the application, we
would change to the chapter10 directory, and start the application
server as follows.

  cd chapter10
  node app.js

Enjoy!
