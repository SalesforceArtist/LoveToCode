Most of the code provided in this book is not bound to a specific JavaScript runtime
environment, so it could run in any JavaScript environment. However some examples are
specific for the Web browser environment, so the console of Web Inspector such as Chrome
Developer tools or Firebug is needed.

Chapter 1 has no codes.
