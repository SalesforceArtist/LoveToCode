1. Set the encoding of the style sheet to Unicode UTF-8:

@charset "UTF-8";


The @charset rule specifies the character encoding used in the style sheet.

The @charset rule must be the first element in the style sheet and not be preceded by any character. If several @charset rules are defined, only the first one is used. The @charset rule cannot be used inside a style attribute (on an HTML element), or inside the <style> element where the character set of the HTML page is relevant.


To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.

What is Character Encoding?
ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). ASCII defined 128 different alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes.

ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.

Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8.

The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:

<meta charset="UTF-8">

If a browser detects ISO-8859-1 in a web page, it defaults to ANSI.







2. The slideToggle() method toggles between slideUp() and slideDown() for the selected elements.

This method checks the selected elements for visibility. slideDown() is run if an element is hidden. slideUp() is run if an element is visible - This creates a toggle effect.






3. class1.class2	

<div class="name1 name2">...</div>
	
Selects all elements with both name1 and name2 set within its class attribute
