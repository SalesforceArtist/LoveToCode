1. The element>element selector is used to select elements with a specific parent.

Note: Elements that are not directly a child of the specified parent, are not selected.






2.The element1~element2 selector matches occurrences of element2 that are preceded by element1.

Both elements must have the same parent, but element2 does not have to be immediately preceded by element1.




3. The <label> tag defines a label for a <button>, <input>, <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, or <textarea> element.

The <label> element does not render as anything special for the user. However, it provides a usability improvement for mouse users, because if the user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control..

Tip: A label can be bound to an element either by using the "for" attribute, or by placing the element inside the <label> element.
